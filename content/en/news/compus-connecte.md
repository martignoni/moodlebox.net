The "MoodleBox in Detention" campus is a winner of the call for projects "Connected campuses, third places of proximity and pursuit of studies" launched as part of the third part of the Future Investment Program. Led by the Normandy Region, in partnership with the Rectorate of Caen, the University of Caen Normandy and the Caen Penitentiary Centre, it enables students incarcerated at the Caen Penitentiary Centre to benefit from a digital environment to follow courses at the University of Caen Normandy and other institutions at a distance.

This project is the result of an [experiment conducted by the University of Caen Normandy since 2017]({{< relref "caen" >}}).

> Lack of Internet access is a barrier to distance learning for inmates.

For three years now, students have had access to the university's Moodle remote learning platform, thanks to a small mobile server as big as a matchbox. It is the University Multimedia Teaching Centre of the University of Caen that is in charge of synchronising the course spaces on the Moodlebox deployed at the detention centre.

The Campus connected label will give a new dimension to the Moodlebox, offering access not only to UNICAEN training, but also to training from other higher education institutions.

> The vast majority of universities use the Moodle platform. It will therefore now be possible to enrich the Moodlebox with new distance learning courses offered across France.

MoodleBox is a small, inexpensive mobile device that works without the Internet. It combines a wireless access point with a complete Moodle platform.
